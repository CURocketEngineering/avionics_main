# Naming Convention
Naming the progress of the avionics bay is the most fun part. The convention
follows `[color] [color] [number]` describing 
`[mindsim progress] [tested progress] [version]`. 

The order of the colors are as follows:
1. RED
2. BLUE
3. GREEN
4. ORANGE
5. GOLDEN

For instance, the fifth version of the software that is halfway capable, 
but fully functioning for that halfway capability is `GREEN GOLDEN 5`.

*If you wanted to understand programming naming conventions and standards, we 
follow Pep-8.*
