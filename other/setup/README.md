# Setup
Python3 is required for this project. There is no
preference for anything less than python3.8.

### Testing
Aside from the pip modules in `setup-test.sh`,
an HID library is also required. On arch this is
`python-hidapi` and on ubuntu/raspbian this is
`libhidapi-dev` and `libhidapi-hidraw0`.

### Pi
The avionics bay can be set up from `setup-pi.sh`.
